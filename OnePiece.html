  Monkey D. Luffy is the adventurous teenager that puts together the Straw Hat Pirates in his quest to become the king of the pirates. He is stubborn, bull headed and emotional, but he also shows fierce loyalty to his friends and anyone in need of help. Using his Gum-gum fruit powers that turn him into a rubber man, he can take down any foe that gets in his way. With his trademark straw hat and his usual big smile, Luffy has become an icon of not only the show One Piece but of anime and Japan as well.
